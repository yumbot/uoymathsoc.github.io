We are a society aimed at everyone with an interest in mathematics. With social and academic motives we organise public lectures delivered by globally renowned external speakers who are leaders in their field, study groups aimed at ensuring you are fully supported with your exam preparation, as well as a diverse array of social events; including a few trips away in the forthcoming year.

## Our current committee consists of:

<div>
{% for member in site.data.committee.members %}
    
    {% if member.itsUsername == null %}
        {% break %}
    {% endif %}
    
    <h3> {{ member.name }} - {{ member.position }} </h3>
    <img style="float: left;" hspace="20" src="{{ site.url }}/images/portrait_{{member.itsUsername}}.jpg" onError="src='{{ site.url }}/images/portrait_.jpg'">
    
    <p>
        {% assign bio = site.data.committee.bios.[member.itsUsername] %}
        {% if bio == null %}
