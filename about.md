We are a society aimed at everyone with an interest in mathematics.
With social and academic motives we organise public lectures
delivered by globally renowned external speakers who are leaders
in their field, study groups aimed at ensuring you are fully
supported with your exam preparation, as well as a diverse array
of social events; including a few trips away in the forthcoming
year.
