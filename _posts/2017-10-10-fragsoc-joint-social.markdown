Oh boy do we have a big social planned for this week! We have teamed up with the amazing FragSoc, booked out a big room, dusted off our copies of super smash, got the vr out and set aside money for a big pizza order for an absolutely massive games session.  

Come down to AEW/104 7:00pm on Wednesday to hang out with us and play some games! This event is open and free of charge to all our paid members.
